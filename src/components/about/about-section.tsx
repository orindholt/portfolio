					Hello!
				</h3>
				<p>A fullstack web developer based in Copenhagen</p>
				<p>
					I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and readable code
					that&apos;s easy to interpret and scale.
				</p>
				<p>
					I excel in learning new technologies and languages, documenting
					development processes, and building responsive fullstack solutions. My
					focus area is on modern tech-stacks, but I&apos;m adept at seamlessly
					integrating and adapting to older and legacy tech environments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Described by classmates, coworkers, and myself as a team player,
					trusted ally, and quick learner.
